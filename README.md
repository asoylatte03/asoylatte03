☕ Hi, Hola, Piyalli! I'm Kevin! 

🍂 I'm currently a Data Science Student at Flatiron School where I'm learning Python, SQL, hypothesis testing, regression, as well as the basics of machine learning. I'm a graduate of NYU's Applied Psychology program where I built a 
strong research background in the fields of cultural inquiry, education, and psychology. As an undergrad, I spent three years as a research assistant for NYU's Home School Connections Lab transcribing early childhood classroom interactions as well as holistically coding 
their retelling of a wordless picture book. My experiences at NYU have inspired me to build foundational knowledge in data science to better understand its applications within the education space. I enjoy thinking critically through each iterative process of the data science lifecycle. 

📚 My research interests broadly encompass early childhood education, billingual education, language acquisition, fandom, learning styles, cross-cultural storytelling practices, and more! 

💞️ Outside of code, I enjoy reading speculative fiction books in my spare time as well as playing strategy/MMORPG games.
