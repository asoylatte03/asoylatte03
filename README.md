☕ Hi, Hola, Piyalli! I'm Kevin! 

🍂 I'm currently a Data Science Student at Flatiron School where I'm learning Python, SQL, and the basics of machine learning. I'm a graduate of NYU's Applied Psychology program where I built a 
strong research background in the fields of cultural inquiry, education, and applied psychology. As an undergrad, I spent three years as a research assistant for NYU's Home School Connections Lab tracking children's literacy development through a pilot oral storytelling program in NYC schools. My undergraduate experience has prepared me to better understand the applications of psychology as well as the principles behind psychological research in real-world settings to embark on the data science learning path. I wish to work within the intersection of education, psychology and data science to present key insights that are the product of critically evaluating a product at each iterative stage of it's lifecycle. My goal is for companies and organizations to better understand the needs of their users/community members to create better, and more sustainable products. 


📚 My current research interests broadly encompass early childhood education, billingual education, language acquisition, fandom, learning styles, cross-cultural storytelling practices, and more! I am passionate about understanding cross-cultural experiences, diasporic experiences and how the language of storytelling can be used to create sustainable products and interventions for communities of interest. 

💞️ Outside of code, I enjoy reading speculative fiction books in my spare time as well as playing story rich, strategy and MMORPG games.
